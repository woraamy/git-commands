## Commands for Remotes

1. List all your remote repositories and show their URLs:
   ```
   git remote -v
   ```

2. View details about a remote repo named `origin`, including all the remote branches and local tracking branches for `origin`:
   ```
   git remote show origin
   ```

3. (Pushing a new branch) You commit some files to the `dev-foo` branch and try to "push" them to Github, but it fails as shown here:

   ```
   cmd>  git checkout dev-foo
   cmd>  git push
   fatal:  The current branch dev-foo has no upstream branch. 
   ```
   Explain this error.
   > Need to use the command git push -u dev-foo before checkout because at first Git can't track the branch "dev-foo"


4. The command to push `dev-foo` to `origin` as a **new remote branch** on `origin` is:
   ```
   git push origin dev-foo
   ```


5. (Create a local tracking branch for a remote branch) The remote repository (`origin`) has a branch named `e2e-test` that you don't have in your local repository.   
   The command to create a new local branch as a copy of the remote `e2e-test` branch that **tracks** the remote branch is:
   ```
   git checkout -b local-e2e-test origin/e2e-test
   ```
   
6. Consider this situation:
   - you have a local repository with a remote repo on Github
   - Your local repo is up-to-date with the remote repo on Github!
   - You edit `README.md` on Github using Github's web interface and save the changes.
   - On your local machine, you edit README.md, commit the changes locally
   What happens when you `push` your changes? Explain why and how to fix it.

   > Because GitHub web interface and I have made different changes to some part of the README.md file. The situation can be solved by
   ```
   git fetch origin
   ```

7. The command to change the URL of the remote "origin" to a new URL, such as `https://hostname/newuser/new-repo-name`, is:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://hostname/newuser/new-repo-name
   ```
   This situation occurs when:
   - you change the name of a repo on Github
   - you transfer ownership of a Github repo to someone else
   - you move from Github to another hosting site, like Bitbucket
   - you want to switch from the https to the ssh protocol (the remote URL is different)    

8. To create a *second* remote repository for your local repo, the command to add a remote named "bitbucket" with the URL "https://bitbucket.org/your-username/git-commands" is:
   ```
   git remote add bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/your-username/git-commands
   ```
   - Note: you must **create** an empty repo on Bitbucket. This command just adds it as a remote, it won't create the remote repo.

9. After adding the remote named `bitbucket`, the command to push your master branch to `bitbucket` is:
   ```
   git push master bitbucket
   ```
